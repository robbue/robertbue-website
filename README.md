# `robertbue.no`

My personal website created in 2018. Built with Nuxt.js.

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).

### Running locally

To develop the website locally, you'll want to run the development server:

```sh
# install the dependencies
yarn

# start local development
yarn run dev
```

> Note: This requires Node.js and npm to be set up locally, see [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) for more information.

### Create build

Build and starting are seperate commands:

```sh
# build for production
yarn run build

# run production server
yarn start
```

### Generate static project

To develop the website locally, you'll want to run the development server:

```sh
# generate static project
yarn run generate
```

### Deploy to Heroku

To deploy the app to Heroku:

```sh
# deploy to Heroku
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git push heroku master
```

Or deploy manually from Heroku. The Heroku app is connected to my GitHub.

> Note: This requires [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) to be set up locally.
